# Interactivity
The piece had an obvious way for users to interact and change the state of the project. It would have been good to have some sense of why it was important for the mouse moving to change the piece in the way that it does.

# Code Quality
You used the assets of the P5 library well and had a good command of the functions available to you there. You also did well in commenting the code and talking about why certain pieces behave in the way they do.

The path to the image you wanted to load wasn't accurate in your code and didn't load by default unless I changed it.

# Aesthetics
There's obviously a need for projects that touch on these topics, and I'm happy to see you confronting it in two projects in different ways. As I said in the Interactivity, I would have liked to see a bit more of a sense of *why* it's good to address this issue in this way: your Python project had a great build-up to its ultimate statistic that created a really great effect. It would have been good to see a bit more of that here.
